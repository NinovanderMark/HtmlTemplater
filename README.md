# What is HTML Templater
HTML Templater is a static site generator where the templates and content are all straightforward HTML.

[![Continuous Deployment](https://github.com/NinovanderMark/HtmlTemplater/actions/workflows/cd.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/NinovanderMark/HtmlTemplater/actions/workflows/cd.yml)

HTML Templater should be considered **unstable** for production use, as I'm still figuring out what functionality it needs, and how to best implement that. Expect things to change a lot until the first v1.0 release.

# Getting started
The documentation is built using HTML Templater, and deployed to GitHub pages. 

It can be found at [https://htmltemplater.ninovandermark.nl/](https://htmltemplater.ninovandermark.nl/).

The source files for this website can be found in the `htmt` folder in this repository.

## Examples
My [personal website](https://github.com/NinovanderMark/Ninovandermark.github.io) has been re-built using HTML Templater, and the repository is a decent example on how a typical setup might look like.

# How to build HTML Templater
Check out the source code and open the `src/HtmlTemplater.sln` file with either Visual Studio or JetBrains Rider. Alternatively, the `dotnet` CLI can be used to build and run the solution. Ensure that the **.NET 8 SDK** is installed.
